Minimal notes for scaffolding out chunks of story ideas. Idea's are atomic at this level, but then become dependent on higher levels when they inter-connect. i.e., I should be able to jot down ideas for any of these headings at any time - but later think about taking "lower level" ideas and how to adapt them to fit them into the higher level ones. Doing this should in theory lead to many ideas about an *actual* story outline and arcs that keep in mind all of the higher level concepts.

e.g., 
1. What's an overall vague concept for a story that would be interesting to explore. (The reason to write, or a central theme)
2. What sort of world and setting aids that concept. (Establish grounding truths)
3. What sort of characters aids that concept and live in that world. (Establish empathy hooks for readers)
4. What are the friction points that naturally occur against all of those. (Searching for antagonists and obstacles)
5. What defines a "win" against those friction points.

Those are the initial ideas, after which we can do some higher level refinement:

1. After those are set out, we can start imagining how those items combined evolve into actual story / character arcs, and how that might impact things. (Use the above levels as guide rails)
2. Flesh out each level again with more details, now that we have ideas for specific character and world inflection points.

## 1. General Concepts (The overall premise / story)

e.g., Undead are extremely rare - but not inherently evil. They don't have a personality change. They just can't die. How does that change the world, a person, and society? What would you do with eternity if you were still just yourself, no powers, except being unable to die.

### Exploring the concept

- Why do people *think* undead are evil - did a specific undead give that reputation?
- What happens to undead that have been trapped for centuries; did they go mad?
- What motivates an undead in the first year? The first generation? The first century? The first millennia?
- What advantages are they able to accrue? What limits their abilities?
	- They can learn patterns and psychology through experience
	- They can't "play" the same person indefinitely; family and friends will die or get suspicious etc?

## 2. World ideas

- Does the "source" of endless life matter to the story? Is it known?

## Character Concepts

- e.g., Maybe an undead who doesn't understand how or why they became undead - perhaps the person / deity who turned them was captured and imprisoned before they could explain their plans for them?
