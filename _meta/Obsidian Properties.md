# Uses of Obsidian Properties

Properties are meta-information to define or describe things about the note itself.

- "Note properties" describe things as they relate to the writing process.
- "Meta properties" describe the content and context of the note as it relates to the story.

These are ones I find useful, and I also find it useful to keep this file and document what new Properties I come up with and what values they might have - just for reference later.

# Note Properties
## Note Type

Describes the main subject type for the note - "what type of content is this note?"

- `Research`
- `Character`
- `Location`
- `Organisation`
- `Scene`
- `Chapter`

## Note Status

How well defined are the contents of this note? "How done is it?"

- `Rough` (an initial idea or outline)
- `Draft` (more detailed, but still in progress and active development)
- `Completed` 
- `Revision` (in the process of being amended)
- `Revised` (has been amended)

# In-world Meta Properties

A note may involve things you want to track without explicitly mentioning those things in the text itself. Use properties to track these.
## Characters

Lists the characters "present" in the scene.
## Viewpoints

Lists viewpoint characters, or third-person.

## Locations

Lists Locations the scene takes place in.
