Don't scroll down yet! Unless, of course, you've already read me once...

...What was that first sentence? How bizarre!

The reader's eyes traced over the text on the screen, they'd been sold on the suggestions of the README file, and some of it made sense. Some of it didn't. Like those first two sentences. "I should forget about that right now", you think to yourself. "I'm sure I'm about to have an epiphany if I jus-" But right at that moment the weight of a penny struck, the light of a bulb illuminating, a _realisation_ - what you are reading _right now_ was what The Author had called "A Scene". An atomic note that could be tracked and tagged, they claimed, yet could also somehow be seamlessly part of a greater whole.

"Huh, so I guess this author wants me to write _individual scenes_ in their own files..." you think, unbidden, as though an external power compelled you.

You thought this thought from the comfort of a nice chair in your own house, slowly beginning to make sense of the Obsidian Vault you've just downloaded.

"...and if I mention something in this note, which is from another note, I could _link it_ in the main text, like for example I ought to find out who [[Characters/The Author|The Author]] is. Oh wow, look at that! Neat."

Your brow furrows briefly; "or, I suppose, if it doesn't make sense to link in the actual prose - maybe because the scene is from the point of view of someone who's never actually mentioned, I could use the Properties panel to link that information instead".

The Reader glanced to the right, and indeed found a Properties panel listing things about the very document they were in the process of reading. In fact, you notice something about those properties: "Holy wowzers, look, it knows that this scene is happening in my own house! My god, everything is tracking everyone everywhere now!"

The Reader shifted a little in their chair, before deciding that this must just be an example of how Properties could be useful to add extra context to a scene that isn't in the actual scene text. It probably wasn't some sort of CIA tracking.

"But, if I write my scenes as their own files - what's the point of that? How on earth can we bring structure and order to a disparate collection of notes!". 

The Author was confident this would become apparent, indeed all the reader had to do was consider it for a moment and they were _certain_ to come to the very same way of thinking as the author - if only because the author was equally certain he could plant actual thoughts directly into their mind. Like this:

"Ah, dear Reader - the thing about writing in scenes is you can concentrate on the scene itself and then later think about how it should be integrated into the whole - to _split it up_ if needed, or _move it around within the prose_. How? By using the ability to _embed_ one Note inside another!"

The reader was a little stunned. Partly by the concept and partly because it did feel a little like they'd lost some of their own volition somehow.

"Come on, you've seen that this document is a Scene, it's own file with its own Properties - let's go look at a chapter we'll pull this very scene into! Christ I'd better knock one up hadn't I? Ok, here's an [[Story One/Chapters/Example Chapter|Example Chapter]]. Go on, click the link!"

The Reader wasn't a fan of this strange sort of mind control, but clicked the link anyway...
