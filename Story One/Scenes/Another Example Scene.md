STOP SCROLLING!

You just clicked a link... and found yourself reading the very same thing you'd just been reading! Like some sort of very crap deja-vous.

Yes indeed Reader, welcome back.

What you see here on the screen right now, above you, isn't a duplicate copy of that first Scene. Not at all. This type of Note you're reading (assuming you can see a ton of text above this sentence) is a Chapter - and all it does is _embed_ multiple Scenes into itself. It's nothing more than _ordering_ scenes together.

I know it's tough to believe, but I'll prove it to you: See up in the User Interface up there? The book (or pencil) icon and the other icon with the three dots in a row? We're going to click the dots in a moment.

Notes can be viewed in three ways: Reader Mode, Editing Mode, and Source Mode. Reader Mode is "I'm all done changing stuff, show me what I wrote!", Editing mode is sort-of-that but lines your cursor is on show the editing interface. Source Mode is the raw MarkDown text that makes the note itself.

Click the Three Dots one and then select "Source Mode". WAIT... you'll want to get back here after. So remember to click the three dots again switch to Reader Mode after.
