Did you see all of that text you'd been reading just _vanish_? Poof! And instead there are two line of text that reference two Scenes? That's the magic of this idea. Those are just [Obsidian Embeds](https://help.obsidian.md/embeds). And this text here? This is normal text in the "Example Chapter" file. Which shouldn't normally be here, because Chapters should be nothing but embeds. But this way you can see what's going on with Embeds and still read this text while you look.

Ok, switch back to Reading Mode. Three dots > Reading view.
